# Pathfinding Algorithms

## 1. Introduction
Pathfinding algorithms are essential tools used in computer science to determine the shortest or most efficient route between two points in a graph or maze. These algorithms have applications in robotics, video games, navigation systems, and artificial intelligence. This project demonstrates the implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* (A-star) algorithms to solve pathfinding problems and visualize the results.

## 2. Problem Domain
The primary objective is to navigate through a grid-based maze or graph and find the shortest path from a given start point to a target point. Challenges include:
- Navigating around obstacles.
- Balancing computational efficiency and memory usage.
- Adapting to dynamic environments where nodes or paths might change.

## 3. Solution Domain
This project implements and compares two widely-used pathfinding algorithms:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An unweighted graph traversal algorithm that guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.
2. **A* Algorithm**: A heuristic-based approach that combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search to find the shortest weighted path efficiently.

Visualization is incorporated to provide a clear representation of how these algorithms operate in real-time.

## 4. Technology
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Visualization Library**: Matplotlib or Pygame
- **Graph Representation**: Adjacency matrix or adjacency list
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)

## 5. Data Structures Used
1. **Queue**: Used for BFS to explore nodes level by level.
2. **Priority Queue (Heap)**: Used for A* to prioritize nodes based on the cost function.
3. **Graph Representation**:
   - **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array for dense graphs or grids.
   - **Adjacency List**: A dictionary for sparse graphs.
4. **Set**: For tracking visited nodes.
5. **Dictionary**: For storing parent relationships in reconstructing the path.

## 6. Methodology
### Step 1: Input the Maze or Graph
- Define the grid size and initialize the maze with walls, start, and target points.

### Step 2: Implement BFS
1. Initialize a queue with the start node.
2. Explore each nodeâ€™s neighbors, marking them as visited.
3. Stop when the target node is reached.

### Step 3: Implement A* Algorithm
1. Initialize a priority queue with the start node.
2. Calculate the cost function:
   - `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`
   - `g(n)`: Cost from the start node to `n`.
   - `h(n)`: Heuristic estimate from `n` to the target (e.g., Manhattan distance).
3. Expand the node with the smallest `f(n)` value.
4. Stop when the target node is reached.

### Step 4: Visualization
- Use Matplotlib or Pygame to dynamically render the grid, showing visited nodes, the frontier, and the final path.

### Step 5: Performance Analysis
- Compare the algorithms based on:
  - Execution time.
  - Number of nodes explored.
  - Path optimality.

## 7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical applications of BFS and A* in pathfinding. While BFS guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs, A* provides an efficient approach for weighted graphs, leveraging heuristics to reduce computational overhead. Visualizing these algorithms enhances comprehension and highlights their strengths and limitations in various scenarios. Future extensions may include incorporating dynamic obstacles or experimenting with other heuristics for A*.
